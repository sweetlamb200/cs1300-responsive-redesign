        <h4 style="text-align:center;">REASON TO CHOOSE THIS WEBSITE</h4>
        <p>We all know the simplicity of Warren Buffet and I personally admire it. The website for Berkshire Hathaway is rather too plain and blank. While minimalism is a good thing, this is not something you would expect when you hear Berkshire Hathaway, a multi-billion dollar firm. I chose this website because I feel like all other Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries website are top-notch while this is not. I understand that they want to keep a simple website, so that's why I want to build a simple but better website for them.</p>

        <h4 style="text-align:center;">PROBLEMS</h4>
        Overall the website has no major usability issues, everything is self-explanatory and any non-user can understand what to do, but there are still a few problems:
        <ul>
            <li>Bad Information architecture: There are too many links on a single page and no headings or sub-headings to differentiate between the links.</li>
            <li>The font size of subtext:  The subtext of each link is too small and too hard to read.</li>
            <li><b>Responsiveness:</b> Even though the website is responsive but the font size of everything becomes too small  On mobiles the width is too big, it does not reformat for different screens.</li>
            <li><b>Credibility:</b> Berkshire Hathaway is one of the world’s most credible companies but when you go to their website, don’t you think once maybe you clicked something wrong?</li>
            <li><b>Memorability:</b> This website is actually very memorable but for the wrong reasons, people remember this because it is so simple not because it is so great.</li>
            <li><b>Less information:</b> The company wholly owns GEICO, Duracell, Dairy Queen, and many other companies, but only GEICO is listed on the website.</li>
            <li><b>Bad font:</b> I do not think Times is a good font for this website</li>
            <li><b>Conceptual model:</b> Don’t really get what the website does or who is the website for.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 style="text-align:center;">WAIVE FINDINGS</h4>
        My Waive Observations were:
        <ul>
            <li>WAIVE showed that language is missing, which means it doesn’t have the lang attribute in the index.html, this could be a problem if someone wants to translate the page into some other language. This should be there since Berkshire Hathaway must deal with other countries' companies.</li>
            <li>There is no page region (No header, nav, main, footer, or aside HTML regions, or banner, navigation, main, or content info landmark roles.)</li>
            <li>There are two links to the same page (GEICO).</li>
            <li>It showed 6 small texts as noted in the problems section above.</li>
        </ul>
        I do agree with the findings of WAIVE.
